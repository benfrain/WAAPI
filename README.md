# Animations with the Web Animations API

This repository includes all the files and folders used in the 'Animating with the Web Animations API' video course.

Each folder contains the code as it is at the end of each relevant video (e.g. vid3 contains the code as it was at the end of the 3rd video).

Any questions you can reach me on twitter [@benfrain](https://twitter.com/benfrain), via my site [https://benfrain.com](https://benfrain.com) or open an issue on this repository.
